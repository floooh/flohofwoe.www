## A Bit of History

I grew up in East-Germany during the 70's and 80's near the
small town of Schwarzenberg close to the Czech border in a region called Erzgebirge.
'Erzgebirge' literally translates to 'Ore Mountains' for the rich deposits 
of iron and silver ore which were mined here between the 13th 
and 17th century. If you have read Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle: Jack and Eliza 
must have crossed the mountains somewhere nearby when they travelled from 
Joachimsthal to Leipzig.

In the dark ages, before the Erzgebirge was colonized by settlers, the mountains 
were sometimes called "Miriquidi", which is a Latin bastardization of the northern 
word Mirkvidr, meaning the "Dark Wood" which separated the barbarian hordes
of Attila the Hun from the slightly less barbarian German tribes.

Tolkien's "Mirkwood" (or "Duesterwald" as it is called in the German
translation) is directly derived from the word Mirkvidr. So Middle-Earth's Mirkwood is
actually Earth's Erzgebirge, and should you travel there during a cold and rainy
November day, you'll see that this is the truth.

Mining was barely profitable after the Spaniards flooded
the market with cheap American silver from Potosi in the 16th and 17th century, 
the miners basically became early victims of what today is called globalization, 
and for a few hundred years it became quiet in the Erzgebirge until after WWII 
when suddenly a new 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berggeschrey" target="_blank">Berggeschrey</a>
happened.

When the Americans and Soviets moved in and won the war, they left a
small triangle unoccupied in south-eastern Germany, right around
Schwarzenberg for almost two months. Nobody really knows why, and there's 
a good amount of conspiracy theories around it. Today this short era is 
known as the "Free Republic of Schwarzenberg", a wonderfully utopian name that
never existed in reality. The truth behind it is probably very simple. 
The Soviets, coming from the East, seemed to have stopped where planned, 
but the Americans moving in from the West started to run out of fuel, 
and didn't consider the no-mans-land ahead to be important enough to 
move in full-force, since the war was already over anyway.

At least that's the story I heard about 10 years ago from an
American WWII veteran via email (supposedly a survivor of the famous 
101st Airborne Division) who claimed to have seen the end of WWII as a POW 
in Schwarzenberg. Take this with a grain of salt, I have no way of proving 
whether this is fact or fiction ;)

Fact is though that right after the war, after the Soviets moved in and the Americans 
out of East Germany, one of the biggest mining operations in history started 
when huge amounts of Uranium were discovered, which in the
following 30 years became the main source of Uranium for the Soviet nuclear
weapons program.

## 1984

Some time in 1984, when I was a 12 year old boy, my older brother brought 
a strange electronic device home from work: an 
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC80" target="_blank">LC-80</a>. This was a minimalistic
8-bit computer with a Z80-compatible CPU, and a whopping
1 kByte of RAM (of which only 256 bytes were actually usable for machine code
if I remember right). This thing was unlike any western computer of the
late 70's or 80's. For starters, you didn't connect it to a TV, but there was
a 6-digit segmented LED display (4 digits for the address, 2 digits for the byte
content). Instead of a QUERTY keyboard there was the casing of a pocket 
calculator which allowed to input hexadecimal numbers.

I was immediately hooked by the mysterious aura of the device, but didn't really 
know what I was doing. The manual was complete gibberish to me, but I was able
to type program code I didn't understand into the machine and get some blinking
lights and beeping sounds as output.

Then after a few months, some mystical transformation happened. 
Within 2 or 3 days somehow I "knew" programming. The
assembly instructions and registers suddenly made sense to me and I 
realized how I could arrange them differently, and that I could write
a simple, working program that WASN'T printed in the manual! From this
moment on, everything else became unimportant and I knew that I was to
be a programmer.
