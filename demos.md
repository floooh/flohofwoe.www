## Nebula3/emscripten demos

Currently the demos are still hosted at Google: <a href="http://n3emscripten.appspot.com/" target="_blank">http://n3emscripten.appspot.com/</a>

The Google AppEngine hosting has a 1GB volume limit per day, and the implementation
is also a bit of a hack, since AppEngine wasn't created for hosting static web content.

These limitations were the main motivation to finally get my own web space, and I'll move
the demos over here soon.
