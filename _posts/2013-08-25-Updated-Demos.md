title: PNaCl demos!

All demos now come in 2 flavours: emscripten and PNaCl. If you haven't heard of it,
PNaCl is Google's technology to run native code in the browser (or rather: in Google Chrome).
This is very alpha and probably won't run out of the box (PNaCl must be enabled in
Chrome / Chrome Canary). Also, the emscripten demos have been compiled with the latest
emscripten SDK version (incoming branch).
